# Online Shop API – Spring Boot

This project is a Spring Boot–based REST API that powers an online shop. It is responsible for handling all communication between the frontend web application and the backend, including sending and receiving product data.

## Features

- RESTful endpoints for managing shop resources
- Integrated PostgreSQL persistence
- Automatic table generation via JPA

## SQL Scripts

In order for the project to work, please create the database using the script in `src/main/resources/sql`.
As previously mentioned, the tables will be autogenerated upon the first run if the database exists.

Please make sure to change `${DB_USERNAME}` and `${DB_PASSWORD}` in `application.yml` according to your current PostgreSQL credentials.
